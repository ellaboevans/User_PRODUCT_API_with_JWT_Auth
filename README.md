## Usage
The user and product creation functionality allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of users and products. The user creation includes user registration with a unique email and password, as well as user login with validation checks and error handling. The product creation includes adding, updating, and deleting products with validation checks for required fields.

The JWT authentication feature allows users to securely access the application using a token-based authentication system. This includes generating a JWT token upon user registration or login, verifying the token on protected routes, and handling token expiration and invalidation.

The project is built with a modular and organized code structure, making it easy to customize and extend. It also includes robust error handling and validation checks to ensure data integrity and security.
